Hi! I'm a freelance developer and data visualisation consultant, Based in Oxford, UK. I spend most of my time building data based solutions for clients around the world, specifically around data visualisation. I've also been a developer and software architect on several high profile projects.



I have a passion for data sense making, visualisation and web based technologies. Most notably I've worked with PivotViewer, a data exploration and visualisation tool, and have ported it to HTML5 from the ground up.



I like to be involved with the local and international technical communities and have recently presented on data visualisation at the PASS Summit 2012 in Seattle, and on PivotViewer in Wellington, Brisbane, Canberra and Adelaide at the 2012 SQL Saturday events. In addition he also regularly speaks at the Adelaide Port80, SQL Server and SharePoint User Groups.
