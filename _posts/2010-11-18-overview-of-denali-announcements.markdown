After a whirlwind trip to the US I'm back from SQL Pass 2010. It was an awesome conference, I can honestly say that I learnt a lot, met some great people and generally has a good time.

I'm planning to put together a series of posts that covers the new features and announcements to be in SQL 2011 a.k.a. Denali. Below is the 30 000 foot view of some of what I'm planing to cover



	
  * Project Atlanta

	
  * T-SQL enhancements

	
  * Data Quality Services

	
  * Column-store indexes

	
  * PowerPivot and BISM

	
  * Project Crescent (SSRS)

	
  * Parallel Data Warehouse

	
  * SSIS enhancements

	
  * CTP's and possible release date
