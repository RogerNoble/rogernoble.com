Two months ago[ I posted about a project ](http://www.rogernoble.com/2012/02/02/addressing-the-elephant-in-the-room-the-html5-pivotviewer/)that I've been working on during down time here at LobsterPot, a port of the Silverlight PivotViewer control that has been built exclusively on web technologies - HTML5 and JavaScript. If you're not familiar with PivotViewer it is a visualisation tool that I've always felt never got the attention it deserved.

So I put an early version out there to see what people thought - not expecting much. Well I can honestly say that the response has been overwhelmingly positive, I've been inundated with requests to finish it off as people were exited to build collections with their own data.

So I'm pleased to announce that the LobsterPot HTML5 PivotViewer is now an Open Source project hosted on CodePlex. You can find it here: [http://lobsterpothtml5pv.codeplex.com](http://lobsterpothtml5pv.codeplex.com/).

The control is still very much a work in progress and there are still pieces of functionality that is missing. I'll be updating the documentation over the next few days and the plan is to continue work on the control so that it can render static CXML based collections as well as its Silverlight counterpart.

If you've got an existing CXML based collection then please download the source and let me know how well it does/doesn't work as well as if there are any bugs or functionality that is missing. The LobsterPot HTML5 PivotViewer has been built as a jQuery plugin with extensibility in mind. I'll be posting more about ways that the control can be enhanced, including how get started extending it to work with other data sources.

Going forward the plan is to have two versions of the control: The open source version that will support static CXML based collections and a paid version that will be enhanced with dynamic collections, tile templates and additional views for mapping, data grids and charts. If you're interested in having [LobsterPot ](http://www.lobsterpot.com.au)build a collection for you please [contact us](http://lobsterpot.com.au/contact).
