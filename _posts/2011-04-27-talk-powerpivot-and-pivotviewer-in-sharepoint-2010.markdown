Last Tuesday I gave a talk on using PowerPivot and PivotViewer in SharePoint 2010 to the [Adelaide SharePoint User Group](http://www.sharepointusers.org.au/Adelaide/default.aspx).
The material was based on CTP2 of the [PivotViewerÂ Extension for Reporting Services](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=796AFF73-37FC-4AC2-9595-2C9AA72EB278).

I thought the talk went really well, and I want to thank SharePoint MVP Daniel Brown ([blog](http://www.danielbrown.id.au)) for letting me present to the Group. He has also kindly hosted the slide deck on his blog [here](http://www.danielbrown.id.au/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=51).
