When thinking recently about ways to fast track self improvement to be honest starting a blog was not at the top of my list. I already have a [blog](http://prodactor.blogspot.com/), but I haven't used it in a long time, and it's looking kinda sad.

I'm presenting in a few weeks at the Adelaide SQL Server User Group (AdSSUG from now on) and my topic is on what's new in SQL Server 2011 (Denali). Now to prepare I could just type something up in my word processor of choice, but I want to make the whole process a bit more open. In the next few days and weeks I'll be posting here anything that I can find on Denali as I prepare for my talk. I'll also be attending Pass Summit 2010 which is where more will also be announced.

In the future expect to see posts on SQL Server, SharePoint and general BI.

Enjoy
