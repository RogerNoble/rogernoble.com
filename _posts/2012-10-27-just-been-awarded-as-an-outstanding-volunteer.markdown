Today I was surprised and honoured to find out that I have been awarded as an [Outstanding Volunteer](http://www.sqlpass.org/Community/Volunteers.aspx) for helping out with PASS - the [Professional Association for SQL Server](http://www.sqlpass.org/).

 I have to say that I really wasn't expecting to be nominated, volunteering with PASS is something I do for fun and to help enrich the SQL Server community. Nominations for Outstanding Volunteer are done anonymously but I wanted to say thanks to whomever it was, I also wanted to say thanks to Amy Lewis ([twitter](https://twitter.com/amy_lewisAZ)) who has been a huge help in getting the Australian/New Zealand BI VC event's off the ground.
