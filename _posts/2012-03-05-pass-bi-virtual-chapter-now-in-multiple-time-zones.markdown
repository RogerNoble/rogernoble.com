For those of you who are familiar with the [PASS and the Business Intelligence Virtual Chapter](http://bi.sqlpass.org/) you may be interested to know that I have recently started volunteering my time (if you're not familiar with the [virtual chapters that PASS](http://www.sqlpass.org/Community/VirtualChapters.aspx) run and work with SQL Server, then I would strongly recommend checking it out). If you're a regular reader Marco Russo's ([blog](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/marco_russo/) \| [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/marcorus)) or Chris Webb's ([blog](http://cwebbbi.wordpress.com/) \| [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/Technitrain)) you would be aware that they with Jen Stirrup ([blog](http://www.jenstirrup.com/) \| [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/jenstirrup)) and Alberto Ferrari ([blog](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/alberto_ferrari/) \| [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/FerrariAlberto)) are helping to organise sessions in European friendly time zones. The exciting news is that starting this month (March 2012) there will also be regular sessions held at a time when us Australians and New Zealanders will (hopefully) be awake.

The first session organised will be presented by Bhavik Merchant ([blog](http://bhavikmerchant.wordpress.com/) \| [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/bhavikmerchant)) on [Blazing SSIS! High Performance Design Techniques](http://bi.sqlpass.org/Webinars/tabid/2567/ModuleID/3413/ItemID/391/mctl/EventDetails/Default.aspx?selecteddate=3/29/2012). It will be held at 12pm Brisbane time, which I've done for a few reasons - first is that they are without daylight savings so it will always be held at the same GMT offset. The other reason is that it's hopefully at a time that works well for people both in Perth and Wellington - if anyone has any feedback on that please let me know.

If you're interested in speaking please send your details, speaking experience, session titles and abstracts to [PASSDWBIVC@sqlpass.org](mailto:PASSDWBIVC@sqlpass.org). Submissions from all are welcome as without volunteers none of this would be possible.

Big thanks to Amy Lewis ([twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/amy_lewisAZ)) for helping to make all this happen.
