I recently gave a presentation at [SharePoint Saturday Adelaide](http://www.spsevents.org/city/Adelaide/Adelaide2014) on creating portable single page applications with AngularJS in SharePoint.Â I was really happy with the way the talk went and I got some great questions which told me that there is a huge amount of interest in building JavaScript applications within SharePoint 2013.

The presentation is [available here on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/roger_noble/portable-single-page-applications-with-angularjs-in-sharepoint) and a .zip containing the demo can be [downloaded here](http://www.rogernoble.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SharePoint-Saturday-2014.zip).
